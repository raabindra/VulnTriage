Confidence Engine (Phase 6)

Produces a composite *confidence* score (0-100) for each normalised finding and
classifies it as Confirmed / Needs Manual Verification / Not Confirmed.

Design principle — confidence is NOT severity
---------------------------------------------
"Confidence" here means **how likely the finding is a true positive** (worth an
analyst's time), NOT how damaging it would be if real. Those are different axes:
a Critical-severity finding is not inherently more likely to be *real* than a
Low one. Severity is already captured by CVSS/ML priority and is reported
separately. Every factor below is therefore chosen as a *reliability* signal.

Factors and weight rationale (weights sum to 100)
-------------------------------------------------
  scanner_agreement     25  Independent corroboration. The single strongest
                            passive signal: if N separate tools flag the same
                            issue it is far less likely to be one tool's quirk.
  severity_consistency  20  Does the ML severity model AGREE with the scanner's
                            reported severity? Agreement means the finding's
                            metadata is internally consistent (not a mis-parse or
                            noisy entry). This is the ML model's contribution to
                            *confidence* — via agreement, not via magnitude.
  cve_availability      15  A finding mapped to a catalogued CVE corresponds to a
                            known, real vulnerability class — more credible.
  exploit_availability  15  A known public exploit means the class is real and
                            weaponised, raising the prior that it is genuine.
  poc_validation        15  Direct active evidence from our own controlled check.
                            (A *confirmed* PoC also hard-overrides the class.)
  cwe_mapping            10  A recognised weakness class — weak corroboration that
                            the finding is well-formed rather than spurious.

These weights are a documented, defensible default. They are exposed via the
`WEIGHTS` dict and the engine is weight-agnostic, so a sensitivity analysis can
sweep them without code changes (see scripts/evaluate_confidence.py).

Classification thresholds:
  70-100  ->  Confirmed
  40-69   ->  Needs Manual Verification
  0-39    ->  Not Confirmed
